## Setting up
Enter the token credential inside config.py and it should be good to go. 

If you want to use the league api to get ranked stats or if you want to use lolfantasy, just enter the information
needed inside config.py also.

When using the lolfantasy module, you need to download PhantomJS, extract the zip, get the path to phantomjs.exe
and place it inside the directory variable in config.py.

## Goals
- Learn more Python to do more cooler things

- Improve coding structure

- Gather data about players from games they've played

- More to come in the future..
