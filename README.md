* ```requests``` package
 
* ```beautifulsoup4``` package

* ```urllib3``` package


##### If you want to use the FantasyLCS commands

* ```selenium``` package 

* PhantomJS

## Commands
```You can get the fantasy league ID here when you go to your fantasy league page. When you look at the URL, there will be numbers displayed at the end (i.e http://fantasy.na.lolesports.com/en-US/league/[ID found here])```

## Setting up
If you wish to use a separate account to run the bot, then you can just fill in the email, password, LoL API Key, and
region inside config.py. You must also enable the client to use the email and password in lolbot.py and disable it from using
the token. (By default, the bot will use the token. I'll probably make this more user-friendly in the near future.)

If you wish to use oauth2, then you can just enter the Token, LoL API Key, and region inside config.py.

When using the lolfantasy module, you need to download PhantomJS, extract the zip, get the path to phantomjs.exe
and place it inside the directory variable in config.py.

## Goals
- Learn more Python to do more cooler things

- Improve coding structure

- Gather data about players from games they've played

- More to come in the future..
