# LoLDiscordBot
A WIP Discord Bot for League of Legends created using Python 3.5 along with the API Wrapper written by Rapptz.

## Requirements
Python 3.5+

discord.py from https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

```requests``` library

## Features
As of right now, this bot only has the ability to return the ranked stats of a given player using $rank.

For example, if you type "$rank -summoner name here-" into the discord chat the results:
```
-Summoner Name Here-
--------------------
Tier: -tier here-
Division: -division here-
LP: -# of LP here-
Wins: -# of wins here-
Losses: -# of losses here-
```

## Goals
-Learn more Python to do more cooler things

-Improve coding structure

-Implement LoL Fantasy commands that returns certain stats, teams w/l ratio, etc.

-More to come in the future..
